## 2021-10-07 - Retiring Shield

As we continue to refine MITRE Engage based on feedback from the community, we will be retiring MITRE Shield on October 
18th. After that day, the [shield.mitre.org](https://shield.mitre.org/) url will redirect to 
[engage.mitre.org](https://engage.mitre.org/). Shield will still be accessible in an archive 
[on Github](https://github.com/MITRECND/mitrecnd.github.io), however MITRE will no longer be supporting the Shield 
framework. If you are currently using Shield, it is strongly suggested that you follow 
[this guide](https://engage.mitre.org/resources/shield) on migrating from Shield to Engage. If you have any questions 
or would like to provide feedback, please contact us at [engage@mitre.org](mailto:engage@mitre.org).

## 2020-12-01

MITRE Shield was updated to use MITRE ATT&CK v8. This includes:

* New ATT&CK Tactics of [Reconnaissance]({{ site.baseurl }}/attack_mapping/TA0043/) and [Resource Development]({{ site.baseurl }}/attack_mapping/TA0042/)
* New ATT&CK Techniques
    * Not all new ATT&CK Techniques were mapped to Shield Techniques. If you have suggestions for mappings, please see our [Contributing]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/contribute) documentation.

We also added new [Adversary Group Mappings]({{ site.baseurl }}/attack_groups/) based on ATT&CK Groups, and expanded the definition of [Hunting]({{ site.baseurl }}/techniques/DTE0021) to be more proactive.
